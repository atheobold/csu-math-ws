## What is R? What is RStudio?

The term "`R`" is used to refer to both the programming language and the
software that interprets the scripts written using it.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com) is currently a very popular way to not only write
your R scripts but also to interact with the R software. To function correctly,
RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

To make it easier to interact with R, we will use RStudio. RStudio is the most
popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R. An IDE is a piece of
software that provides tools to make programming easier.


## Why learn R?

### R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that's a good thing

The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the
results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing
and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that's a good
thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data,
you don't have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain
your results; you just have to run your script again.

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the
code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and
spot mistakes.

Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are
doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.

### R code is great for reproducibility

Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the
same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.

R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you
collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the
statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically.

An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be
reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.


### R is interdisciplinary and extensible

With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R
provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many
scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your
data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population
genetics, and a lot more.


### R works on data of all shapes and sizes

The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether
your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won't make much difference to
you.

R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data
types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient.

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your
computer or on the web.


### R produces high-quality graphics

The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any
aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.


### R has a large and welcoming community

Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through
mailing lists and websites such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/),
or on the [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/). Questions which
are backed up with [short, reproducible code
snippets](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) are more likely to attract
knowledgeable responses.


### Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform

Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this
transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else)
find some, you can report and fix bugs.

Because R is open source and is supported by a large community of developers and
users, there is a very large selection of third-party add-on packages which are
freely available to extend R's native capabilities.

## A tour of RStudio


## Knowing your way around RStudio

Let's start by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.

The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the
[Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email
support from RStudio, Inc.

We will use the RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer,
inspect the variables we create, and visualize the plots we generate. RStudio
can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages,
writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information
you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, RStudio
provides many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file
types you use while developing in R. RStudio makes typing easier and less
error-prone.


### The RStudio Interface
Let's take a quick tour of RStudio.

![RStudio_startup](../fig/R_00_Rstudio_01.png)

RStudio is divided into four "panes". The placement of these
panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options ->
Pane Layout).

The Default Layout is:

- Top Left - **Source**: your scripts and documents
- Bottom Left - **Console**: what R would look and be like without RStudio
- Top Right - **Environment/History**: look here to see what you have done
- Bottom Right - **Files** and more: see the contents of the project/working directory here, like your Script.R file


## Installing additional packages using the packages tab

In addition to the core R installation, there are in excess of
10,000 additional packages which can be used to extend the
functionality of R. Many of these have been written by R users and
have been made available in central repositories, like the one
hosted at CRAN, for anyone to download and install into their own R
environment. You should have already installed the packages 'ggplot2'
and 'dplyr. If you have not, please do so now using these instructions.

You can see if you have a package installed by looking in the `packages` tab
(on the lower-right by default). You can also type the command
`installed.packages()` into the console and examine the output.

![Packages pane](../fig/packages_pane.png)

Additional packages can be installed from the ‘packages’ tab.
On the packages tab, click the ‘Install’ icon and start typing the
name of the package you want in the text box. As you type, packages
matching your starting characters will be displayed in a drop-down
list so that you can select them.

![Install Packages Window](../fig/R_00_Rstudio_03.png)

At the bottom of the Install Packages window is a check box to
‘Install’ dependencies. This is ticked by default, which is usually
what you want. Packages can (and do) make use of functionality
built into other packages, so for the functionality contained in
the package you are installing to work properly, there may be other
packages which have to be installed with them. The ‘Install
dependencies’ option makes sure that this happens.

## Your turn! {.tabset}

### Exercise 

**Use both the Console and the Packages tab to confirm that you have the tidyverse
installed.**

### Solution

Scroll through packages tab down to ‘tidyverse’.  You can also type a few
characters into the searchbox.  

The ‘tidyverse’ package is really a package of packages, including
'ggplot2' and 'dplyr', both of which require other packages to run correctly.  

All of these packages will be installed automatically. Depending on what
packages have previously been installed in your R environment, the install of
‘tidyverse’ could be very quick or could take several minutes. 

As the install proceeds, messages relating to its progress will be written to
the console. You will be able to see all of the packages which are actually
being installed.

### Additional remarks

Because the install process accesses the CRAN repository, you
will need an Internet connection to install packages.

It is also possible to install packages from other repositories, as
well as Github or the local file system, but we won’t be looking at these
options in this lesson.

## Installing additional packages using R code

If you were watching the console window when you started the
install of ‘tidyverse’, you may have noticed that the line

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

was written to the console before the start of the installation messages.

You could also have installed the **`tidyverse`** packages by running this command directly at the R terminal.
