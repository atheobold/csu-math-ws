## Introduction

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

## Project Organization

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![Figure 1: Screenshot of file manager demonstrating bad project organisation](../fig/bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.


### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place
where R will look for and save files. When you write code for your project, your
scripts should refer to files in relation to the root of your working directory
and only to files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory
is set up properly. If you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some
reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the
RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser to where your working
directory should be, clicking on the blue gear icon "More", and selecting "Set
As Working Directory". Alternatively, you can use 
`setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to reset your working directory. However,
your scripts **should not** include this line, because it will fail on someone
else's computer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>
If the first line of your R script is

`setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")`

I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE ðŸ”¥.

If the first line of your R script is

`rm(list = ls())`

I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE ðŸ”¥.

</p>â€” Dr. Jenny Bryan (@JennyBryan) </blockquote>


## A possible solution 

![](../fig/rstudio-project.png)

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management
functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
project.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its "Projects"
interface, which not only creates a working directory for you but also remembers
its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it). The interface also
(optionally) preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to
resume work after a break.

> ## Challenge 1: Creating a self-contained project
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
>* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
>  `New project`
>* Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory") and choose a convenient
>  location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the
>  day (e.g., `~/csu-workshop`)
>* Click on `Create project`
>* Create a new file where we will type our scripts. Go to File > New File > R
>  script. Click the save icon on your toolbar and save your script as
>  "`script.R`".


The simplest way to open an RStudio project once it has been created is to click
through your file system to get to the directory where it was saved and double
click on the `.Rproj` file (the blue cube). This will open RStudio and start
your R session in the same directory as the `.Rproj` file. All your data, plots
and scripts will now be relative to the project directory. RStudio projects have
the added benefit of allowing you to open multiple projects at the same time
each open to its own project directory. This allows you to keep multiple
projects open without them interfering with each other.

> ## Challenge 2: Opening an RStudio project through the file system
>
>
> 1. Exit RStudio.
> 2. Navigate to the directory where you created a project in Challenge 1.
> 3. Double click on the `.Rproj` file in that directory to open the RStudio 
> project.


## Best practices for project organization

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized and make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you might
create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **figures**. Here
are some examples of suggested directories:

 - **`data/`** Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate datasets.
   For the sake of transparency and [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance), you
   should *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of
   your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts,
   rather than manually) as possible.
 - **`data_output/`** When you need to modify your raw data,
   it might be useful to store the modified versions of the datasets in a different folder.
 - **`documents/`** Used for outlines, drafts, and other
   text.
 - **`fig_output/`** This folder can store the graphics that are generated
   by your scripts.
 - **`figs/`** This folder contains any figures necessary for your reports (e.g., 
 images, gifs). 
 - **`scripts/`** A place to keep your R scripts for
   different analyses or plotting.

## Project management principles 

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier. The paper on 
[Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) gives the following
recommendations for project organization:

>1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
> 2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
> 3. Put raw data and metadata in the `data` directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
> 4. Put source for the project's scripts and programs in the `src` directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the `bin` directory.
> 5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.


### Treat data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

### Data cleaning

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing
to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful.
This task is sometimes called "data munging". Storing these scripts in a
separate folder, and creating a second "read-only" data folder to hold the
"cleaned" data sets can prevent confusion between the two sets.

### Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

There are lots of different ways to manage this output. Having an output folder
with different sub-directories for each separate analysis makes it easier later.
Since many analyses are exploratory and don't end up being used in the final
project, and some of the analyses get shared between projects.


### Separate function definition and application

One of the more effective ways to work with R is to start by writing the code you want to run directly in a .R script, and then running the selected lines (either using the keyboard shortcuts in RStudio or clicking the "Run" button) in the interactive R console.

When your project is in its early stages, the initial .R script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these functions into two separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.

### Save the data in the data directory

Now we have a good directory structure we will now place/save the data file in
the `data/` directory.

### Avoiding duplication

You may find yourself using data or analysis scripts across several projects.
Typically you want to avoid duplication to save space and avoid having to
make updates to code in multiple places.

In this case, making "symbolic links", which are essentially shortcuts to
files somewhere else on a filesystem, can let you use existing code without
having to move or copy it. Plus, any changes made to that code will only have
to be made once.

On Linux and OS X you can use the `ln -s` command, and on Windows you can
either create a shortcut or use the `mklink` command from the windows terminal.

## Downloading the data and getting set up

Download the gapminder data from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv).

- Right mouse click on the link above -> "Save link as" / "Save file as", or
click on the link and after the page loads, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>
or choose File -> "Save page as"

- Make sure the data are saved under the name `gapminder_data.csv`
- Save the file in the `data/` folder within your RStudio project.


## Inspecting files with RStudio terminal {.tabset}

### Exercise 

We will load and inspect these data later, but it is useful to get some general
idea about the dataset, directly from the command line, before loading it
into R. Understanding the dataset better will come in handy when making
decisions on how to load it in R. 

Let's use the command-line shell or terminal in RStudio to answer the following
questions:

1. What is the size of the file?
2. How many rows of data does it contain?
3. What kinds of values are stored in this file?

### Solution 

We can know the file size with: 

```{r ch2a-sol, engine='sh', eval = FALSE}
ls -lh data/gapminder_data.csv
```

We can know how many lines (rows) are in the data with: 

```{r ch2b-sol, engine='sh', eval = FALSE}
wc -l data/gapminder_data.csv
```

We can see a preview of the data with:

```{r ch2c-sol, engine='sh', eval = FALSE}
head data/gapminder_data.csv
```

## Version Control

It is important to use version control with projects. Go [here for a good lesson which describes using Git with RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio/).
