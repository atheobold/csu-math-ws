## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the
shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate,
print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is to do arithmetic:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can hit <kbd>Esc</kbd> and RStudio will give you back the ">" prompt.

> ## Tip: Canceling commands

> If you're using R from the command line instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>

>
> Canceling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:

> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 * Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 * Exponents: `^` or `**`
 * Multiply: `*`
 * Divide: `/`
 * Add: `+`
 * Subtract: `-`

```{r}
3 + 5 * 2
```

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.

```{r}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
```


The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:

```{r}
2/10000
```

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:

```{r}
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
```

## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we can type its name, followed by open and closing parentheses.
Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function's
arguments:

```{r}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
```

```{r}
log(1)  # natural logarithm
```

```{r}
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
```

```{r}
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
```

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can look them up on Google, or if you can remember the
start of the function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it
has auto-completion abilities that allow you to more easily
look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they
take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page
for that command. When using RStudio, this will open the 'Help' pane;
if using R in the terminal, the help page will open in your browser.
The help page will include a detailed description of the command and 
how it works. Scrolling to the bottom of the help page will usually 
show a collection of code examples which illustrate command usage. 
We'll go through an example later.

## Comparing things

We can also do comparisons in R:

```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r}
1 < 2  # less than
```

```{r}
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
```

```{r}
1 > 0  # greater than
```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r}
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

```{r}
x
```

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in the top right panel of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:

```{r}
log(x)
```

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:

```{r}
x <- 100
```

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:

```{r}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods but no spaces. They
must start with a letter or a period followed by a letter (they cannot start with a number nor an underscore). 
Variables begining with a period are hidden variables. 
Different people use different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:

```{r}
x = 1/40
```

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. In contrast to physics and
mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the
same data type. For example

```{r}
1:5
2^(1:5)
x <- 1:5
2^x
```

This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an
upcoming lesson.


## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):

```{r}
ls()
```

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't give any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R prints a bunch of code instead of a listing of objects.

```{r}
ls
```

What's going on here? 

Like everything in R, `ls` is the name of an object, and entering the name of
an object by itself prints the contents of the object. The object `x` that we
created earlier contains `r x`:

```{r}
x
```

The object `ls` contains the R code that makes the `ls` function work! We'll talk
more about how functions work and start writing our own later.

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)
```

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:

```{r, error=TRUE}
rm(list <- ls())
```

> ## Tip: Warnings vs. Errors
>
> Pay attention when R does something unexpected! Errors, like above,
> are thrown when R cannot proceed with a calculation. Warnings on the
> other hand usually mean that the function has run, but it probably
> hasn't worked as expected.
>
> In both cases, the message that R prints out usually give you clues
> how to fix a problem.

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

Packages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages tab of the lower right panel in RStudio. Clicking on this tab will displas all of installed packages with a checkbox next to them. If the box next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded and if it is empty, the package is not loaded. Click an empty box to load that package and click a checked box to detach that package. 

Packages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the Install and Update buttons at the top of the tab.
