## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is to do arithmetic:

__Practice__: Enter each of the following commands and confirm that the response
is the correct answer.  

</br>

```{r calculator, eval = FALSE}  
1 + 2 
16*9
sqrt(2)
20/5
18.5 - 7.21
3 %% 2 ## what is this doing?
```


# Creating Objects 

These operations, however, are not very interesting. To do more useful things in
`R`, we need to assign values to an object. To create an object, we tell `R` the
object's name, followed by an assignment arrow (`<-`), and finally the value of 
the object. This would look something like this:

`x <- 6`

Once we execute/run this line of code, we notice that a new object appears in 
our environment window. This window shows all of the objects that you have 
created during your `R` session. The value of `x` appears next to it, since it 
is a scalar. 

__Remarks:__  

* In the above code `<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the 
right to objects on the left. So, after executing `year <- 6`, the value of 
`year` is `6`. The arrow can be read as `6` goes into `year`. For historical reasons,
you can also use = for assignments, but not in every context. Because of the 
slight differences in syntax, it is best practice to always use `<-` for 
assignments.  

    + In RStudio, typing Alt at the same time as the - key will write `<-` in a 
    single keystroke. Neat!   

* There are a few simple rules that apply when creating the same of a new object
(like we did above):  

    + `R` is case sensitive, so if you name your variable `cat` but then try to 
    run the code `Cat + 2`, you will get an error saying that `Cat` does not exist  
    + You also want your object's name to be explanatory, but not too long. 
    Think `current_temperature` verses `current_temp`. Do you really want to 
    type out temperature every time?  
    + Finally, you cannot begin any object's name with a number. You can end a 
    name with a number (e.g. clean_data2), but does that give you much 
    information about what is in the contents of `clean_data2` relative to 
    `clean_data`?    
    + The name cannot contain any punctuation symbols, except for `.` and `_` 
    (`.` is not recommended)  
    + You should not name your object the same as any common functions you may 
    use (`mean`, `sd,` etc.)  
    
* Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your 
future self and your collaborators. In `R`, three popular style guides are 
Google's (https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html), Jean Fan's 
(https://jef.works/R-style-guide/) and the tidyverse's 
(https://style.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse's is very comprehensive and may 
seem overwhelming at first, but you'd be surprised what good code writing habits
can do for your collaborations!


## Clean Code 

Yes, writing code may be completely new to you, but there is a difference between
code that looks nice and code that does not. Generally, object names should be 
nouns and function names should be verbs. It is also important that your code 
looks presentable, so that a friend/college/professor can read it and understand
what you are doing. For these reasons, there are style guides for writing code 
in `R`. The two main style guides are Google's 
\href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml}{(link)} and the slightly 
more comprehensive Tidyverse style guide 
\href{https://style.tidyverse.org/}{(link)}. Optionally, you can install `lintr`
to automatically check and correct for issues in your code styling. More on 
packages to come!


# Working with Objects 

When you assign a value to an object (like we did previously) `R` does not output
anything by default. If you enclose the code you wrote in parenthesis, then `R` 
will output the value of the object you created. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
(x <- 6)
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

Once the object has been created, you can use it! Run the following lines of code:

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
2.2 * x
4 + x 
x %% 3
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

We can also overwrite an object's value, so that it has a new value. In the code
below create a new object `y` and then we give `x` a new value of 2. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
y <-  x + 6
x <- 2 
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

**Exercise 1:** What is the current value of `y`? 12 or 8?  

# Working with Different Data Types 

A vector is the basic data type in `R`. A vector is a series of values, which 
can be either numbers or characters, but every entry of the vector must be the 
same data type. `R` can tell that you are building a vector when you use the 
`c()` function, which concatenates a series of entries together. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
temps <- c(50, 55, 60, 65)
temps
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

To make a vector of characters, you are required to use quotation marks (" ") to 
indicate to `R` that the value you are using is not an object you already 
created in `R`. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
animals <- c("cat", "dog", "bird", "fish")
animals
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

Important features of a vector is the type of data they store. Run the following
lines of code and decide what type of data the vectors contain. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(temps)
class(animals)
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

**Exercise 2:** Create a vector, named `dec`, that contains decimal valued numbers. Then check
what data type does that vector contain?

```{r}
# Exercise 2 code here!
```

\newpage

Another possible data type is a logical (Boolean) value. This type of data  
takes on values of `TRUE` and `FALSE`. But, we said that vectors could only be 
numbers or characters. If `TRUE` and `FALSE` don't have quotations around them,
then they aren't characters. So, then they must be numbers. What numbers do you 
think they are?  

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
class(logic)
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

**Exercise 3:** What happens when we try to mix different data types into one 
vector?
Speculate what will happen when we run each of the following lines of code:

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_logic <- c(1, 2, 3, FALSE)
char_logic <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
guess <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

In each of these vectors, the two types of data were *coerced* into a single 
data type. This happens in a hierarchy, where some data types get preference 
over others. Can we draw a diagram of the hierarchy?  

# Lists  
 
While the elements of vectors have to be of the same data type, a list is a
special vector in `R` that allows for you to store a variety of types of 
objects. If you have a vector, a matrix, a character, you can store all of them
into one list object!

The arguments to the list function are the components of the list. Where the 
components can be characters, vectors, matrices, or other data structures. 
Here, we create a list whose components are the three vectors we've been 
working with:

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
my_first_list <- list(animals, temps, logic)
my_first_list
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

We notice that when printing a list, the output looks a bit different. There 
are a whole bunch of brackets! Let's break them down. I like to think of a list
as a shelf with cubby holes. The cubby holes are the components of the list, 
but there are elements in each cubby.  

* To get to a specific component (cubby) of a list, you use the double brackets
next to the name of the list (e.g `my_first_list[[1]]`).  
* To access the elements inside each cubby, you then use single square brackets 
(e.g. `my_first_list[[1]][2]`).

### Named Lists

```{r}
my_named_list <- list(title = "statistics", 
                      numbers = 1:10,
                      data = TRUE)
my_named_list
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

We see the output for a named list is slightly different. Instead of double 
brackets next to each component, there are now `$` and names of the variable. 
This will help you understand the structure of data.frames (coming up next)!
