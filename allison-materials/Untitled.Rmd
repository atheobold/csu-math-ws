## Introduction

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

## Project Organization

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.


### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place
where R will look for and save files. When you write code for your project, your
scripts should refer to files in relation to the root of your working directory
and only to files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory
is set up properly. If you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some
reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the
RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser to where your working
directory should be, clicking on the blue gear icon "More", and selecting "Set
As Working Directory". Alternatively, you can use 
`setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to reset your working directory. However,
your scripts **should not** include this line, because it will fail on someone
else's computer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>
If the first line of your R script is

`setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")`

I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE ðŸ”¥.

If the first line of your R script is

`rm(list = ls())`

I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE ðŸ”¥.
